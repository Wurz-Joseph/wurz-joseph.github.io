    <h3>Standard JavaScript Events</h3>
    <p class="content">Clicking the button executes an onclick event that toggles an images' classlist. When the button is clicked once
        a
        show-image class is added to the picture which has the property of display: block. When it's clicked again that
        class is toggled off causing the image to be hidden again.</p>
    
    <button type="button" class="btn" onclick="displayImage()">Toggle Image</button>
    <img src="images/lubbock.jpg" id="image" class="image" alt="Lubbock Texas Temple">
    <p class="content">If the image is currently being displayed there are "mouseover" and "mouseleave" event listeners that will
             enlarge the image and shrink it back to its original size respectively. </p>
    
    <p class="content">On the next example, to trigger the event, you can either click the button on the phone or touch the square using
        a touchscreen
        device. The yellow square has a "touchstart" event listener which fires a moveSquare function which causes the
        animation to occur. The button an onclick event attached to it which also calls the moveSquare function. </p>
