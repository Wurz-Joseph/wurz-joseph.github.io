    <p>
        "CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having
        property
        changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.
        For
        example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous. With
        CSS
        transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be
        customized."<br>

            <h3>Defining Transitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>transition-property</u> - Specifies the name or names of the CSS properties to which transitions
                    should
                    be
                    applied. Only properties listed here are animated during transitions; changes to all other
                    properties occur
                    instantaneously as usual. </li>
                <li><u>transition-duration</u> - Specifies the duration over which transitions should occur. You can
                    specify a
                    single duration that applies to all properties during the transition, or multiple values to allow
                    each
                    property to transition over a different period of time.</li>
                <li><u>transition-timing-function</u> - Specifies a function to define how intermediate values for
                    properties
                    are computed. Timing functions determine how intermediate values of the transition are calculated.
                </li>
                <li><u>transition-delay</u> - Defines how long to wait between the time a property is changed and the
                    transition actually begins.</li>
                <li><u>transition</u> - Shorthand CSS syntax. Is written as follows transition: &lt;property>
                    &lt;duration> &lt;timing-function> &lt;delay>;</li>
            </ul>
